Device Log
==========

Device Log is a web app for logging device maintenance. It allows IT staff to keep track of an organisation's "fleet" of devices, as well as maintaining an inventory of spares.

A full history of each device is kept, so that technicians can troubleshoot problems with adequate knowledge of a device's past repairs and known issues.
